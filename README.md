# FINAL PROJECT by Edwin Pitono and Vinamrata Yadav
# HELLO DOE
Data Analysis Full-Time FEB2021, Paris

Presented on Friday April 2nd 2021

Project Description 
Hello Doe is a startup whose mission is to help companies recruit for student jobs. It uses the social media to market the job offerings in order to get faster response time. The purpose of this final project is to analyze the job market in Paris, France, in order to optimize the conversion rate of the business developper in Hello Doe. If the business developper can find the struggling sector in recruitment on one specific time, by priorizing his efforts to these companies he/ she will have better conversion rate from these clients. In order to organize the efforts and planning, the team also needs an overall view about the job market so they can make projections and plannings. Based on past data, a prediction for the job market in 2021 can also be done.

Questions to answer :
- Visualize the past data of job offer and job requests in Paris. 
- Spot the sectors which struggles to recruit
- Make a prediction for the job market in 2021

Dataset content

Workflow

1. Dataset import 
   API and web scraping from the French Employment Agency website. The website contains data about job offers and job requests from actual and recent years. 
2. Data cleaning, data manipulation and data visualization
   The challenge with the datasets from Pole Emploi is the size, the redundancies and the datas present multiple dimensions (places, time and professions) which        present some challenge for the visualization
